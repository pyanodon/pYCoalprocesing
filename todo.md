yey, a todo file. :D

The tar processing unit must have the recipe changed too, as pointed in the foruns, it uses a steel-furnace which will be avaliable only in green tier. Another vestige of the primary versions of this mod before you come. I didnt change anything here or upload to not mess with your work in that stage.

Dirt water have a high production, but in this green tier, have no utility. It will fill several tailings ponds in no time. Dirt water should gain a recipe to use evaporator and produce coal-dirt dust (with a 1K stack), so it can be better stored until the player reaches blue tier and can use that dirt dust in several things i blue and beyond. May i add that recipe or do you prefer to me dont touch the code atm?
