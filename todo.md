The tar processing unit must have the recipe changed too, as pointed in the foruns, it uses a steel-furnace which will be avaliable only in green tier. Another vestige of the primary versions of this mod before you come. I didnt change anything here or upload to not mess with your work in that stage.

Some users pointed that we can use vanilla "steam" to power up the MK01 turbine, since the turbine is more productive than a small row of steam engines, people are cheating with it. I think a sollution may be add the "hot-water" vanilla steam in the list of fluids used by the turbines, but which a yield even worse than the future coal-slurry-water-fuel.
