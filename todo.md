yey, a todo file. :D

The tar processing unit must have the recipe changed too, as pointed in the foruns, it uses a steel-furnace which will be avaliable only in green tier. Another vestige of the primary versions of this mod before you come. I didnt change anything here or upload to not mess with your work in that stage.

Dirt water have a high production, but in this green tier, have no utility. It will fill several tailings ponds in no time. Maybe it would be a good idea dirt water can be "voided" in the void pump at least until blue science.

Few balancing numbers must be made too in the methanol and rectisol production/consuption.
